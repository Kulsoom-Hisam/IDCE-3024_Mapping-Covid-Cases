# Tracking COVID-19 cases over time #
This tutorial guides users on how to plot COVID infections over time using the library [MatplotLib](https://matplotlib.org/) and how to make an animated map of COVID infections over time using [Kepler](https://kepler.gl/).

The first part walks users through plotting COVID cases using Matplotlib in [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true) whereas the second one talks about making an animated map on Kepler.

## Part 1: Using Colab to Plot Covid Cases over time ##
The data obtained for Covid cases is obtained from (The Humanitarian Data Exchange)(https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases). The CSV data file is contained in the 'Part 1 Data' folder in this repo.
